This is an example of part of a pipeline using this template, that starts with raw reads and peforms a number of steps (gets up to marking duplicates in the bam files). 
The following scripts are based on the template files in the main directory:

Example_S1_CleanReads.sh: First_Step.sh
Example_S2_BWAMap.sh : Intermediate_Step.sh
Example_S3_MarkDups.sh : Last_Step.sh

See comments within each script for breakdown of what each one does.
